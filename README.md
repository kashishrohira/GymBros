# FitHub

## Introduction
FitHub is a fitness social network and tracking application 
that seamlessly combines *fitness tracking* and *social networking*,
creating a vibrant community of fitness enthusiasts. The application aims 
to provide users with a user-friendly and engaging experience to 
log their workouts, set fitness goals, see their friends' progress 
and connect with like-minded individuals.

When a new user creates a profile, there are a number of 
actions that can be done including:
- Fitness tracking - users can log their workouts including,
exercise type, duration, calories burned etc.
- Follow other users - this enables them to see others' 
workout updates and progress
- Goals and challenges - users can set fitness goals and 
participate in challenges with other users to achieve goals together

## Target Audience
FitHub is intended to cater to users of all fitness levels, 
from beginners seeking guidance to seasoned athletes and 
passionate fitness enthusiasts sharing their expertise.

## Motivation for the project
This project deeply interests me as a fitness enthusiast who seeks
connections with like-minded individuals. Witnessing others'
fitness progress motivates and inspires me to continue pushing my own
boundaries. Hence, developing a fitness social network and tracker allows me to
combine my love for fitness with technology and community-building.
